# ZeroDrift — progress log

## Day 1 (2026-07-14)

**Contract** ✅
- `HedgeRegistry.sol`: immutable, permissionless, per-`msg.sender` epoch log. 9/9 foundry
  tests green (incl. fuzz round-trip, cross-owner isolation). Deploy script ready
  (`contracts/script/deploy-hedge-registry.sh`, forge create --legacy + cast smoke).
  Mainnet deploy pending operator key.

**Perpl trading client** ✅ code-complete, typecheck clean
- `bot/src/lib/perpl-trade.ts`: Ed25519 signin (mt:29), OrderRequest (mt:22) with docs-exact
  retry semantics (same-rq before status/lb, new-rq on expiry, sr:32 handling), heartbeat
  sn tracking + head block from mt:100, snapshot adoption after reconnect, repost-storm cap.
  `PaperPerplExecutor` simulates maker fills from the live L2 book — same interface.
- `bot/src/lib/perpl.ts`: extended market info (order_ttl_blocks, points_boost_bps,
  initial_margin, min_posting_amount) — all fetched from /pub/context, zero hardcoding.

**Testnet findings (probe: `bun run probe:testnet`)**
- Context: testnet MON market is id **64**, name "MON Perp" (mainnet: id 10, "MON") →
  market matching now by symbol/name/first-word. `order_ttl_blocks=6` (~2.4s!) confirms
  the re-post loop is mandatory. Testnet fees 1bps maker / 3.5bps taker. MON size_decimals=0.
- Enrollment: **Origin header must be ABSENT or whitelisted** — unlisted Origin → 400.
  Server-side enroll works with no Origin. Browser enroll from our domain will need Perpl
  whitelisting → paste-key stays the primary web UX.
- **viem EIP-712 gotcha**: must pass FULL `typed_data.types` INCLUDING `EIP712Domain`
  (hex-string chainId + salt in domain). Stripping it (ethers convention) changes the
  digest → 400. Verified digest parity with ethers.TypedDataEncoder.
- Enroll with valid signature → **404 "target profile not found"**: wallet needs a Perpl
  profile first (one-time connect on the Perpl web app). Signature path proven correct.
- Trading WS: bogus signin → close **3401 "unauthorized"** (matches docs; reconnect path
  validated).

**Blocked on operator (for Day 2 order-flow validation)**
1. Create a Perpl profile for the bot wallet: connect wallet once at testnet.perpl.xyz
   (and later app.perpl.xyz for mainnet).
2. Then either `bun run hedger:enroll` (CLI) or create the key at /apikeys and set
   `PERPL_API_KEY` + `PERPL_ED25519_PRIVKEY`.
3. Testnet order-flow validation: place/cancel PostOnly, measure lb expiry, verify fill
   parsing (`bun run probe:testnet` extension).

**Hedger engine** ✅ (pulled Day-3 work forward)
- Full FSM verified in paper mode on LIVE mainnet data: INIT (NT quote $100 → 4528 MON)
  → SPOT_FILLED → HEDGED (maker short fill, exactly 0.9bps fee) → CHURNING → full
  close/reopen round-trip (2×1339 MON maker fills) → HEDGED. Restart-safe (delta guard
  rebuilds the short from durable spot state).
- Bug caught by smoke run: raw delta guard tripped during the churn's own close leg
  (29% > 3% hard) → fixed via `Churner.pendingMon()` exclusion.
- **Mainnet MON market: `points_boost_bps=20000` → 2x points on MON.** ttl=20 blocks.
- Overnight paper run left running (15m churn) — check `bot/data/perpl-hedger*.jsonl`.

## Next

- Day 2: testnet order round-trip with real key (owner-blocked); pin Amount-string scaling.
- Day 3: review overnight paper ledgers; tune churn/reprice.
- Day 4: live smoke $50 + registry mainnet deploy + funding-sign verification.
- Day 5: web UI + deploy hedge.nullterminal.xyz.
- Day 6: polish + submission.

## Day 1 (cont.) — WEB TERMINAL BUILT + DEPLOYED TO VPS

**ZeroDrift web terminal** ✅ (pulled Day-5 work forward)
- Vite + React + viem, no wallet SDK (injected connect). Signature element: spirit-level
  drift gauge. Live vs headless screenshots verified: Perpl book ladder, funding APR
  (+17.5% shorts EARN at build time), 2x points boost, NT spot price, on-chain epoch feed.
- **Gotchas found & solved:**
  - Perpl rejects foreign browser Origins: REST has no CORS headers, WS closes 1002.
    → same-origin `/perpl/*` proxy (vite dev proxy + Caddy `header_up Origin`).
  - `rpc.monad.xyz` caps `eth_getLogs` at **100 blocks** (-32614) → epoch feed reads
    contract views per owner (`epochCount`+`getEpoch`) + rolling 100-block live scan.
- **Deployed**: dist → VPS `/opt/zerodrift/web`, Caddy vhost `zerodrift.caddy`
  (file_server + /perpl proxy), `caddy validate` + reload OK, HTTP 308→https confirmed.
  ⏳ waiting ONLY on owner DNS: Cloudflare A record `hedge` → VPS IP (grey-cloud first
  for ACME; CF API tokens on the box are all invalid — owner dashboard step, ~30s).
- Console flow: connect wallet → paste trade-scope key (localStorage) → maker short with
  auto-repost + churn toggle (runs while tab open) → attest epoch on-chain via wallet.

## Day 1 (cont.) — MAINNET DEPLOY

**HedgeRegistry LIVE on Monad mainnet** ✅
- Address: `0x24BD952B9BaD090Eab24A1a91948fA130c8D3A48`
- Deploy tx: `0x9d63893c688b0e57c5f9ecccba6a5b53aaa6592261e4d9ce148a283ab1481dfc`
- Smoke: epoch #0 opened (tx 0xa0538ac2…) + closed on-chain, EpochOpened event verified.
- Source verified on Sourcify: **exact_match** (visible on monadscan).
- Deployer: relayer wallet (contract is ownerless — deployer has no special rights).

## Day 1 (cont.) — SITE LIVE 🚀

**https://hedge.nullterminal.xyz LIVE** (2026-07-14)
- DNS via owner-supplied CF token: A `hedge` → VPS, grey-cloud → cert issued → flipped
  orange-cloud (origin hidden, serves via CF edge). Record id c62fa9fd…, TTL auto.
- Verified through the full production chain: HTTPS 200, `/perpl` REST proxy 200, and
  the market-data WS through Cloudflare → Caddy → Perpl (book snapshot received).
- Production screenshot: live book, funding +17.5% APR (shorts earn), 2x boost, epochs.

## Day 1 (cont.) — DESIGN OVERHAUL ("no AI slop" pass)

User called the v1 design AI-slop — correct. Full redesign as an **avionics instrument
unit**: aluminum bezel + corner screws + serial plate ("UNIT 001"), annunciator lamps
(FEED/CHAIN/KEYS + HEDGED/DRIFT/REBAL), phosphor LCD readouts with scanlines, live UTC
clock + block-number HUD chips, graduated SVG drift gauge (numbered ±5% scale, real
soft/hard zones marked green/amber/red, glass tube, specular bubble), book as inset
screen, "operation sequence" schematic strip, engraved spec table (real engine params).
Killed: purple radial wash, uniform rounded cards, flat stat strip.

**Testing gotcha:** Chrome headless `--window-size=390` clamps the real viewport to
~440px and crops the PNG to 390 → mobile screenshots showed phantom overflow. Ground
truth via 390px iframe measurement (scrollWidth 384) + real-browser zoom: mobile is
clean. Deployed to production, bundle verified (index-CYmWVlnq.js).

## Day 1 (cont.) — ALL DATA LIVE (no hardcode)

User asked whether page data was real. Audit: ticker/book/epochs/fees/boost were already
live; the terminal log + 3 statstrip numbers were static. Fixed properly:
- Engine now runs as `zd-hedger` container ON THE VPS (paper mode, live mainnet data,
  --network host, NT api via localhost:8421) and mirrors its recent events + totals to
  `/opt/zerodrift/status/status.json` (atomic rename; HEDGER_STATUS_FILE env).
- Caddy serves it at `/status.json` (no-store); the site's terminal card polls every 10s
  → the landing page streams the engine's REAL rolling log (fills, state transitions,
  round-trips, week volume, fees). Stale >60s shows an honest warning line.
- Statstrip now fully derived: maker fee + boost from Perpl context, round-trip = 2×maker,
  funding from WS, round-trips + week volume from the engine feed.
- Local Mac paper run retired in favor of the VPS runner (ledgers kept in bot/data).

## Day 1 (cont.) — terminal polish

- Timeframe switcher on the chart (5m/15m/1h/4h — CandleFeed re-subscribes per resolution).
- Statsbar MARK/SPOT/SPREAD flash mint/red on change (exchange-style tick flash).
- Book upgraded to cumulative depth (SUM $ column + cumulative bars) + row hover.
- "Engine session" panel under the console: state/RT/volume/fees/funding from status.json.
- Chart height tuned to fill its column. All verified on production via real-browser clicks.
